I don't know whether what I make is art,

# interests
I guess what I'm really interested in/about is the internet,
specifically how it affects our emotional & spiritual relationships

(im)material experiences of connections
(or connections through experience)

physical dimensions
_([3, 1]... and others)_,
temporal topologies,
how to travel through time & how to escape it

the subtle fingerprint of human emotions in our APIs
