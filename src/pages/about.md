_glitter // holographics // iridescence_

escaping the mundane 'physicality' that ties us to this plane
& escaping the material laws that constrain us through digital technologies & 3d rendering 

\* \* \*

physical dimensions

temporal topologies as a reality & a spirituality,
how to travel through time & how to escape it 

\* \* \*

the end of: 

~ the universe ~ 

~ humanity ~ 

~ myself ~ 

\* \* \*

communication & the arbitrary nature of language, alphabet, & symbols 

\* \* \*

crystals, fortune-telling, auras, leys & how spiritual beliefs
can clash with science & how they can create their own science
