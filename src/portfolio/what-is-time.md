an experiment in the ideas of decay in a digital form, this video combines an audio
collage from two YouTube video explanation of the nature of time with a computer
generated animation.

the animation is rendered in a way that reflects the physical laws of the world,
while clearly being an object that only exists in digital space.

the breaking down of the audio and the video shows the transient nature of the
digital world, where data can be destroyed very easily, in ways that the physical
world cannot.
