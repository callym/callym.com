trying to explain the concept of tides in emotional energy
(the regular flowing of good to bad, happy to unhappy, wanted to unwanted)
using extracts from an ongoing tarot diary,
definitions of words taken out of context,
and a space designed to feel both teen-bedroom comfort,
and mystic sci-fi unease.

the wooden table hides a capacitive sensor, which when triggered
by the audience holding their hands over its surface,
lights up the room to (un)reveal sections of text.

<div class="serif narrow">
...and as the tug of your gravity grows<br/>
weaker...
<p class="right"><i>
why do you assume it's me that's weakening,<br/>
when it's you that's drifting away?
</i></p>
does it really matter who's to blame, when<br/>
for you it'll always be me, and for me, you?<br/>
the net effect is the same, and after all this<br/>
fighting, the friction between us 
<p class="right"><i>
you're moving too fast for me
</i></p>
moving too fast in a cycle that's going to<br/>
leave me at the same beginning?
