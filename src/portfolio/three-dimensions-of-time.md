an installation of work from our end of first year show.

exploring my ideas and thoughts about time being a socially constructed illusion,
through various media, such as:
<div class="center">
<i>

<br/>~ written doodles ~
<br/>~ wingding translations ~
<br/>~ hourglass-like sculptures ~
</i>
</div>
