an exploration in the meaningless, Box1 expresses the innate human captivity to the
beauty of light and reflections and colour.

following a sequence in which there is programmed patches of psedo-randomness,
it flows through periods of absolute control into periods of LED anarchy,
with the audience not knowing the next move of the path that has been given to it,
giving an impression of strict control that is underlaid with moments of free will.
