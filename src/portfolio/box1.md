an exploration in the meaningless, Box1 expresses the innate human captivity to the beauty of light and reflections and colour.

following a sequence in which there is programmed patches of psedo-randomness, it flows through periods of absolute control into periods of LED anarchy, with the audience not knowing the next move of the path that has been given to it, giving an impression of strict control that is underlaid with moments of free will.

built using cheap replicas of diamonds and antique wood, it has a subtext in exploring what it means to be cheap and expensive in the modern day capitalist society that we live in, where false wealth is more flashy and grand than "real" wealth.
